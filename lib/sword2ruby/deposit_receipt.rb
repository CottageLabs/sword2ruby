module Sword2Ruby
  #The DepositReceipt object is returned following Post, Put and Delete operations on the Sword server.
  #In some cases (e.g. Post), an Atom::Entry will usually be returned describing the newly created entry. Operations such as Delete do not return an Atom::Entry.
  #If the Sword server does not automatically return the Atom::Entry but instead provides a link to it, the DepositReceipt object will automatically fetch it.
  #
  #For more information, see the Sword2 specification: {section 10 "Deposit Receipt"}[http://sword-app.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/sword-app/spec/tags/sword-2.0/SWORDProfile.html?revision=377#depositreceipt].
